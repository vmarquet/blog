**Context:** it's 2021 and static typing is all the rage. [Python did it](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), [TypeScript is at a high usage and satisfaction rate](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/#scatterplot_overview), but Ruby felt lagging behind.

But thanks to Stripe and the [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) project, Ruby is catching up!

**Goal:** this article will demonstrate how to get static typing in your favorite text editor with [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) and [LSP](https://lsp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#about-lsp) for a Ruby on Rails project, **without having to write a single type!**


Installing Sorbet
-----------------

First, we gonna get the typechecker up and running in our terminal.

We follow the basic installation steps from the Sorbet homepage.

Add the following lines to your `Gemfile.rb`:

```
gem 'sorbet', :group => :development
gem 'sorbet-runtime'
gem 'sorbet-rails'  # optional, if using Ruby on Rails
```

Then, using the terminal:

```
bundle install

# Initialize Sorbet, this will generate a sorbet/ directory
bundle exec srb init
```

At the `srb init` step, Sorbet sends us a scary message: `this script will take two potentially destructive
actions`, because it will execute files from the project. If you're afraid of testing it now on your project, you can try this tutorial on a new rails project: `rails new test-sorbet`.

TODO: troublehsooting: what to do when Sorbet crashes here.

Finally, we can run the static typechecking:

```
$ bundle exec srb tc
```

On a fresh Ruby on Rails project, you'll get `No errors! Great job.`. On a real project, you'll probably get a lot of errors, but that's okay.

Let's test that it actually works and finds errors. Let's use the file `app/models/application_record.rb`, which is exists by default for Rails projects, and add the following code:

```
# typed: true
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.abstract_class = true

  def foobar
    baz += foobaz
  end
end
```

Notice the `# typed: true`. [Sorbet has stronger settings](https://sorbet.org/docs/static#file-level-granularity-strictness-levels) such as `# typed: strict` and `# typed: strong`, but those will force you to write some types. Here, we want to get some typechecking for free without having to write any types, so we use `# typed: true`, which will type all variable without types as `T.untyped`.

Let's run the typechecker to see what happens:

```
$ bundle exec srb tc
app/models/application_record.rb:6: Method foobaz does not exist on ApplicationRecord https://srb.help/7003
     6 |    baz += foobaz
                   ^^^^^^
  Did you mean:
    app/models/application_record.rb:5: ApplicationRecord#foobar
     5 |  def foobar
          ^^^^^^^^^^

app/models/application_record.rb:6: Method + does not exist on NilClass https://srb.help/7003
     6 |    baz += foobaz
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Got NilClass originating from:
    app/models/application_record.rb:5: Possibly uninitialized (NilClass) in:
     5 |  def foobar
          ^^^^^^^^^^
Errors: 2
```

Great! It works!

This is exactly what we want, but it would be even better if we didn't even have to launch the typechecker in the terminal.


Integrating the typing errors into your favorite editor with LSP
----------------------------------------

Champ, let's go get that sweet productivity boost ðŸ’°

I'll demonstrate the steps required to enable the integration for Sublime Text 3 with [Sublime LSP](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP), but you can adapt the steps for another editor like Visual Studio Code.

First, install the LSP plugin for Sublime Text:

* go to `Tools -> Command Palette -> Package Control: Install Package`
* type `LSP` to filter the packages
* you should see a plugin from [github.com/sublimelsp/LSP](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP), install it
